# MovieDbCRUDApp
A CRUD application made using ASP.Net and a connection to an SQL database

 Technologies used:

    C#,HTML,CSS
    ASP.NET
    Entity Framework
    SQL server
    Bootstrap
    Git hub

Issues encountered:

    Initial setup of git hub/git bash on a new laptop hindered committing changes
    Homepage carousel images are at different sizes and look displeasing when stretched to look bigger

To run the code it should run if you press start in visual studio, I am using a SQL server but I believe that wont interfere with that, if there are any problems let me know.
